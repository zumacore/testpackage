# zuma/testpackage

This is a just an example zuma/modulize module scaffold to use for testing the `modules:install` command in Modulize. When running tests it's always better to test with a real registered composer package as opposed to mocking one.

This package is built for that purpose.

Feel free to require it from here, or fork/copy it if you need to test other features.
